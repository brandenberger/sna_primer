Sociologists recognize two main determinants of social phenomena, social structure and individual actions (human agency); what is contested is their relative importance. Social structure refers to those larger and relatively enduring features of society which provide the background against which social life is carried out: for example, the class structure. It highlights the fact that human societies have certain regularities in the social relationships which people engage in. Agency, on the other hand, refers to the volitional and purposeful nature of human activity. Social structure is believed to exert a constraining effect on human activity; agency refers to the ability of individuals to act independently of this.\n\nIt is possible to identify three main standpoints in the debate. (1) Some branches of sociology (such as structuralism, functionalism and Marxism) assert that social life is largely determined by social structure, and that individual activities can be explained mostly as an outcome of structure. (2) Other branches (for instance, phenomenological sociology, ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism) reverse this emphasis, stressing the ability of individuals to construct and reconstruct and give meaning to their world. Proponents of this view emphasize the need to provide explanations for social phenomena which reflect the views of the individuals they study. (3) Other approaches stress the complementarity of structure and agency. Social structure influences human actions, but individual activities can similarly influence social structure.\n\n</div>\n\n## \n\n- Think about your study. Or, if you do not have one, come up with an interesting question you would like to work on. With your neighbour, elaborate the questions in the checklist at the end of the bookdown chapter 1 provided.\n- What are possible consequences of your particular research setting, as identified through the checklist? Be prepared to share the results with the group.\n\n\n## \n\n*Day 1*\n\n13.00-14.30\n_Research Design I: Introduction to core concepts_\n\nRelational data and the importance of tie content\nNetwork phenomena on global and individual levels\nNetworks as dependent and independent variables\nSetting boundaries\n\n15.00-16.30\n_Research Design II: Relational data _\n\nEdgelists, adjacency matrices, adjacency lists\nBipartite and unipartite networks\nThe joys and dangers of visualizing social networks\n\n17.00-18.30\n_Highlight of the day :)_\n\nCase Demonstration of the research done in the field from Dr. Filipe Clemente\n\n##\n*Day 2*\n\n8.30-10.00\n_Data Gathering: Including social network questions in survey research _\n\nName generators, hybrid name generators and rosters\n\n10.30-12.00\n_Analysis I: Centrality and structural measures _\n\nIntroduction to basic individual and structural level measures\n\n13.00-14.30\n_Analysis II: R, R, R _\n\nManipulating network data in R (and how to create pretty pictures)\n\n17.00-18.20\n_Analysis III: Inference _\n\nIntroduction of models that can be used for statistical inference with relational data\n\n",
