Their article is also an amazing resource to start your journey into SNA (in sports and beyond).\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}\nlibrary(xtable)\ntypes_of_edges_table <- xtable(read.csv(\"bookdown_resources/Waescher_table.csv\", stringsAsFactors = F, col.names = c(\"Network type\", \"Description\"), row.names = NULL),\n                               caption = \"Types of networks in sports based on Waesche et al.

What are my ties/ links?\n- What is the content of my ties?\n- Do I look at network phenomena at the global or individual level?\n- Are network phenomena my dependent or independent variable?\n- How would I go about setting boundaries for my network?\n\n",
