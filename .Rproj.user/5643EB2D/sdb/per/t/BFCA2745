Sociologists recognize two main determinants of social phenomena, social structure and individual actions (human agency); what is contested is their relative importance. Social structure refers to those larger and relatively enduring features of society which provide the background against which social life is carried out: for example, the class structure. Agency, on the other hand, refers to the volitional and purposeful nature of human activity. Social structure is believed to exert a constraining effect on human activity; agency refers to the ability of individuals to act independently of this.\nNon-extreme approaches stress the complementarity of structure and agency. Social structure influences human actions, but individual activities can similarly influence social structure.\n\n</div>\n\n## <span style=\"color:blue\">Your turn</span>\n\n- Think about your study. Or, if you do not have one, come up with an interesting question you would like to work on. With your neighbour, elaborate the questions in the checklist at the end of the bookdown chapter 1 provided.\n- What are possible consequences of your particular research setting, as identified through the checklist? Be prepared to share the results with the group.",
