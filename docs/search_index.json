(2017) offer a typology of possible networks in sports. Their article is also an amazing resource to start your journey into SNA (in sports and beyond). Types of networks in sports based on Waesche et al. (2017) Network.type Description Competition Networks Results of games, rankings or structural patterns in sport (e.g. two-mode networks such as athletes at same competitions, players in same team). Relative performance or structural patterns are analyzed. Interaction Networks (intra-event) Relations are rule-based elements of the game (e.g. passes), often analyzed for effectiveness. Inter-organizational Networks Network structures between organizations (e.g. collaboration between sport providers, franchises, clubs, event organizers). Intra-organizational Networks Network structures within organizations (e.g. communication among team members or within sport associations). Affiliation Networks Affiliations of social actors with aggregations of social actors (e.g. membership of individuals in organizations, participation of actors at events). Data are usually collected as two-mode networks. Social Environments Representation of a sport-related social environment as a network in which individual sports actors (e.g. athletes, individuals, teams) are embedded. Analysis of support, influence etc. 2.2 Network phenomena: Global and individual levels 2.3 Networks as independent variables What is the influence of structure? 2.3.1 Example: English soccer teams 2.3.2 Example: something with individual-level dependent variable 2.4 Networks as dependent variables How does structure come about? 2.4.1 Example: 2.5 Setting boundaries Nominalist and realist (Wäsche et al. 2017) 2.6 Conclusion: A checklist to inform your research design Am I studying a relational phenomenon? What are my ties/ links? What is the content of my ties? Do I look at network phenomena at the global or individual level? Are network phenomena my dependent or independent variable? How would I go about setting boundaries for my network? 2.6.1 Your turn: Think about your study. Or, if you do not have on, come up with an interesting question you would like to work on. With your neighbour, elaborate the questions in the checklist. Be prepared to share the results with the group. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; e90da25296a50571d76abf0bce36629bed59e1c1 References "]
