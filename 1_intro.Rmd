@Waesche2017 offer a typology of possible networks in sports. Their article is also an amazing resource to start your journey into SNA (in sports and beyond).

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
types_of_edges_table <- xtable(read.csv("bookdown_resources/Waescher_table.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, col.names = c("Network type", "Description"), row.names = NULL),
                               caption = "Types of networks in sports based on Waesche et al. (2017)")
print(types_of_edges_table, type = 'html', include.rownames = F)
```
